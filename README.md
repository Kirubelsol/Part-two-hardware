# Fidget Tracker - M5 Stack Atom

The code in conjunction with the M5 Stack Atom acts as a fidget tracker.  

The code needs to be uploaded to M5 Atom for it to serve as a tracker.


## Installation  

Inorder to upload this code on M5 Atom first download Arduino IDE. Open the code using Arduino IDE. Connect the M5 atom to the computer and upload the code 
from arduino IDE.   You should also install the appropriate libraries to uplad  the code. The most important are the M5 atom, esp32, Fastled, and Adafruit libraries. After this you can try out the M5 atom as fidget tracker but make sure you supply it with power source. 

## Usage 
To use the M5 atom with the code uploaded on it follow the following instruction. 
Search http://192.168.4.1/home on your device. Then press on turn on to activate and start the M5 atom. 
The rate of fidgeting (tapping, sideways, and repitition of the motion) will be displayed in the device (phone or PC).
These values will also be presented on the M5 atom as a color. The first two rows represent tapping the second two rows represent sideways
fidgeting while the last row represent the repetition of the motion.
The beginning color (green) indicates normality while red indicates maximum value of fidgeting for the three attributes.
